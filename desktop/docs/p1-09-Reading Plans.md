On the Study Bible page, the user can access the M'Cheyne plan by clicking on the **Reading Plans** icon **(1)**. This will take the user to the Reading Plans, where the user can read portions of the Old Testament and New Testament every day as part of their daily devotion. 

The user can select the Bible language and version from the drop-down menu **(2)**. When the user clicks on the ‘Reading Plans’ icon, a list of Bible References for the current date **(3)** appears. 

To read a chapter, the user must select it from the list.   

The required Bible chapter appears on the left side of the screen. 

It is possible to read the entire Bible in a year with the M'Cheyne Reading Plan.
